/*
  Warnings:

  - The `status` column on the `TeamUser` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `matchType` on the `Entry` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `climbRung` on the `Entry` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `type` on the `PitQuestion` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
